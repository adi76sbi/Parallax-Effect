            <p class="text"> An adventure is an exciting experience or undertaking that is typically bold, sometimes risky.[1] Adventures may be <br>
                activities with danger such as traveling, exploring, skydiving, mountain climbing, scuba diving, river rafting, or other extreme sports.

    <h2 class="desc">BIKING</h2>
</div>
<p class="text"> To be fit and healthy you need to be physically active. Regular physical activity can help protect you from serious diseases such as<br>
    obesity, heart disease, cancer, mental illness, diabetes and arthritis. Riding your bicycle regularly is one of the best ways to reduce your <br>
    risk of health problems associated with a sedentary lifestyle.

    <h2 class="desc">PARA GLIDING</h2>
</div>
<p class="text"> Paragliding is the recreational and competitive adventure sport of flying paragliders: lightweight, free-flying, foot-launched <br>
    glider aircraft with no rigid primary structure.[1] The pilot sits in a harness or in a cocoon-like 'pod' suspended below a fabric wing.<br>
    Wing shape is maintained by the suspension lines, the pressure of air entering vents in the front of the wing, and the aerodynamic forces of the<br>
    air flowing over the outside.

    <h2 class="desc">SURFING</h2>
</div>
<p class="text">Surfing is a surface water sport in which an individual, a surfer (or two in tandem surfing), uses a board to ride on the<br>
    forward section, or face, of a moving wave of water, which usually carries the surfer towards the shore. Waves suitable for surfing <br>
    are primarily found on ocean shores, but can also be found in standing waves in the open ocean, in lakes, in rivers in the form of a tidal<br>
    bore, or in wave pools.
